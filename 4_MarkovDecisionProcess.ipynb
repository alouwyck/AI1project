    "In reinforcement learning, an agent is acting in an environment, and learning by trial-and-error to optimize its performance in order to gain maximal cumulative reward. The model of the environment can be formalized by a Markov Decision Process (MDP). If the MDP is given, there is no need of a learning agent, and the problem of finding an optimal policy can be solved applying dynamic programming (DP). This is called planning. As the MDP for the Frozen Lake game is known, the optimal policy can be found using these methods. In this notebook Frozen Lake's MDP is discussed, along with the dynamic programming methods to solve it. The solutions can be used later to verify the agent's learning algorithms."

In the starting position, for instance, all actions are possible, because each of them can lead to winning the game with a final reward of 1, even if some actions are not following the shortest path. After all, the game is not about finding the shortest path, the only goal is to reach cell 15 without falling into a hole.

Intuitively, it can be seen as if it combines policy evaluation and improvement in one step by reducing the number of inner iterations to 1. By doing this, it doesn't have to determine the policy explicitely during each outer iteration. This makes it more efficient than policy evaluation.

    "Reinforcement learning is all about finding an optimal behaviour in order to gain maximum total reward. The discount factor is a value between 0.0 and 1.0 and it determines how much weight future rewards are given when calculating this total reward, which is called the return. If the discount factor is equal to 0.0, only the immediate reward is considered, whereas it is equal to 1.0, the future rewards are fully taken into account. If the discount factor is greater than 0.0 and smaller than 1.0, then the future rewards are discounted.\n",

    "The choice of the discount factor depends on the problem to solve. If the MDP is not episodic, meaning that there are no terminal states, then a value of 1.0 is not allowed, as this would make the returns infinitely large. In this case, it is common to set the discount factor to 0.9. In case of episodic MDPs, the discount factor may be set to 1.0, although a smaller value could make the system converge more easily. In all of the above examples, a discount factor equal to 1.0 was applied, because this is the default value in class MarkovDecisionProcess. For Frozen Lake, a discount factor of 1.0 could be considered even the most interesting choice, because the state-value function gives the expected percentage of wins in this case. However, if the shortest path must be found, a discount factor smaller than 1.0 may be a better choice. To get a better understanding of the meaning of the discount factor, some Frozen Lake solutions are presented here in which a different discount factor was used."

When the discount factor is 0.0, the optimal state-value function gives the maximum immediate reward that can be obtained in each state. Therefore all cells have a state-value of 0.0, unless cell 14 next to to the final cell, which has a state-value of 1.0. Because the return only accounts for the immediate reward, the optimal policy doesn't look further than the adjacent cells, and therefore the uniform random policy is not improved, unless in cell 14:"
