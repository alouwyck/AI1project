    "In reinforcement learning, an agent is acting in an environment, and learning by trial-and-error to optimize its performance in order to gain maximal cumulative reward. The model of the environment can be formalized by a Markov Decision Process (MDP), from which the optimal policy can be derived applying dynamic programming algorithms. If the MDP is not known, however, the agent has to find it out by interacting with the environment. In a naive learning strategy, the agent runs many episodes while taking samples to build the MDP. After running these episodes, the empirical MDP is used to approximate the optimal policy applying dynamic programming methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approachs works fine for small problems, but is not efficient when the number of states and actions are large. The reinforcement learning algorithms illustrated in this notebook overcome this problem by calculating the value functions after each step or a number of steps, or after each episode. The newly obtained value functions are used then to update the policy following a so called epsilon-greedy strategy. In this way, these methods combine a policy evaluation step, in which the value functions are updated, with a policy improvement step. This procedure of iterative policy evaluation and improvement is the same as in the Policy Iteration algorithm used to solve planning problems. In reinforcement learning problems, however, the MDP is not known.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore the agent has to expore the environment and collect samples in the same way it does following a naive learning strategy, although collecting samples is done more efficiently by updating the policy. However, exploiting the agent's learning experience fully by improving the policy greedily is not an effective strategy either, as it risks to left some part of the environment unexplored. Epsilon-greedy means that there is always a small probability, epsilon, of chosing a non-optimal action so the environment is still being explored by the agent. The learning algorithms discussed here decrease the epsilon probability with the number of episodes run by the agent, and eventually follow an optimal policy as epsilon becomes neglectably small.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, four reinforcement learning algorithms are illustrated: Q-Learning, N-Step Q-Learning, Monte Carlo, and Value Iteration. The first three algorithms are model free, which means they don't even need an empirical MDP. They use the sampled rewards to approximate the action-value function Q directly. Q-Learning updates the action-value function after each step the agent takes, N-Step Q-Learning does it every N steps, and Monte Carlo after each episode. Value Iteration uses the collected samples to build an empirical MDP from which the state-value function V is updated after each step applying dynamic programming. This algorithm is similar to the Value Iteration method to solve a given MDP in planning problems, although it is not entirely the same as it applies a slightly different Bellman equation and has an explicit policy improvement step.\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective of this notebook is to illustrate these four reinforcement learning algorithms by applying them to the deterministic and stochastic Frozen Lake environment. The hyperparameters with which the agent's learning process can be finetuned are not discussed here in detail, nor are they being optimized. This finetuning is the scope of the next notebook"

    "Using these classes to solve reinforcement learning problems is straightforward. First an environment is created, which is a deterministic or stochastic \"FrozenLake\" object in the following examples. Then a \"LearningStrategy\" object is created implementing the specific algorithm. The constructor requires the number of episodes and the initial policy as input. It also accepts some required and some optional hyperparameters; some of them are common to all strategies, some of them specific to one strategy. All of these input arguments are assigned to attributes with the same name and can be modified after the object was created. Finally, an agent is created which aggregates the environment and the learning strategy objects. Calling the agent's \"learn\" method solves the learning problem applying the given algorithm."

    "Without going into the mathematical details, it is useful to mention that the Q-Learning method tends to underfitting sampled data because it is biased, whereas the Monte Carlo method has high variance and therefore tends to overfitting the sampled data. N-step bootstrapping comes to the rescue as it offers a bias-variance tradeoff: if considering the last step only is too biased whereas considering the whole episode leads to overfitting, then the natural middle ground is to consider N steps. This is exactly what N-Step Q-Learning does: at cost of an extra hyperparameter N, it allows to balance between Q-Learning and Monte Carlo. For small problems such as Frozen Lake, the bias-variance tradeoff problem is not really an issue, but for complex problems, it can boost the agent's learning significantly as too much bias or variance can slow down the learning process in these cases. \n",

    "The final learning algorithm that is illustrated here is mathematically different from the three previous methods as it uses the empirical MDP to update the state-value function V after each step. However, the code that has to be written to let the agent apply this learning strategy is very similar. Concerning the hyperparameters, Value Iteration has no learning rate. Instead it requires a criterion of convergence as it applies an iterative procedure to update the V-values. This criterion is the required precision. To prevent endless looping when this precision cannot be met, a maximum number of iterations can be set. But to be sure the required precision is always obtained, it can be set to infinity: "
