# AI1project
Project - course Artificial Intelligence 1 - TIBL KdG

In this project a Python ReinforcementLearning module is developed which implements different reinforcement learning methods.
The algorithms are illustrated and tested using OpenAI Gym's FrozenLake-v0 environment. Several Jupyter notebooks are written 
explaining in detail how the different classes in the module are applied to solve the Frozen Lake or other reinforcement
learning problem. The notebooks are numbered and it is recommended to read them in this order.

Folder "documenten" contains different documents explaining how the project was set up. These documents are written in Dutch.
The folder also has a HTML document that gives an overview of the different classes in the ReinforcementLearning module by 
means of a UML class diagram created using the free tool VioletUML: http://alexdp.free.fr/violetumleditor.

Folder "lessen_silver" contains a document in Dutch writing out the first three lectures of David Silver's UCL course on 
reinforcement learning: http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/d.silver/web/Teaching.html. 
These lectures can be found online on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pWv7GOvuf0&list=PLqYmG7hTraZDM-OYHWgPebj2MfCFzFObQ.
The R-files in the folder are solutions to some problems discussed in these lectures. The Gambler's problem is adopted from 
Sutton and Barto's standard book on reinforcement learning: http://incompleteideas.net/book/the-book-2nd.html.

Finally, the multi-armed bandit problem was studied briefly. It is discussed in David Silver's ninth lecture and chapter two
of Sutton and Barto's book. The following online blog implements some of the problems discussed in this chapter:

In folder "multi_armed_bandit" two Python scripts are found with implementations.
